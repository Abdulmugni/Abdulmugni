**Summary** : The hotel revenue analysis determined that the hotel's revenue has been growing year over year. 
However, it is important to note that other factors such as changes in occupancy rates and room prices also play a role in revenue growth.
In terms of the parking lot size, the analysis did not specifically investigate the impact of parking on revenue. However, it would be important to consider customer feedback and satisfaction with the current parking situation, as well as any potential increase in demand for parking before making a decision to expand the parking lot.
Trends in the data revealed that occupancy rates and room prices were the primary drivers of revenue.
It's also observed that the revenue increases during holidays, festivals and seasons.

### Requirements

*	Is our hotel revenue growing by year?
*	Should we increase our parking lot size?
* What trends can we see in the data?

### Solution
